## [2.0.0] - 2025-08-02

### üöÄ Major Release - Fragment-Based Architecture

This is a complete architectural rewrite focused on fragment-based generation for parent application integration.

### Added
- **Fragment-Based Generation System**
  - 8 specialized generators (Model, Migration, Requests, Resources, Factory, Seeder, Controllers, Tests, Policies)
  - JSON and YAML output formats for all generators
  - Insertable fragments for parent application integration

- **Enhanced Request Generator with Custom Form Requests Support** ‚≠ê NEW
  - **Configurable Authorization Logic**: Different authorization rules for store/update/custom actions
  - **Custom Validation Messages**: Field-specific validation messages based on field types and rules
  - **Relationship Validation**: Automatic validation rules for belongsTo, belongsToMany, hasMany relationships
  - **Conditional Validation Rules**: Dynamic validation based on field dependencies (e.g., enum values)
  - **Custom Methods Generation**: prepareForValidation(), custom validation methods, and action-specific logic
  - **Multi-Request Support**: Generate custom request types (bulk operations, publish actions, etc.)
  - **Enhanced/Traditional Modes**: Backward compatibility with traditional structure
  - **Complete Test Coverage**: 5 comprehensive tests validating all enhanced features

- **Code Quality Improvements**
  - **PHPStan Level 9 Compliance**: Fixed all static analysis errors for production-ready code
  - **GeometryFieldType Constructor**: Added proper initialization and config handling
  - **Type Safety**: Resolved undefined property access and logical comparisons

- **Core/Extension Separation**
  - New YAML structure with `core:` section
  - Clean separation between core schema and application extensions
  - Support for multiple extension sections (turbomaker, arc, etc.)

- **Complete Integration API**
  - `SchemaService` class with comprehensive parsing and validation methods
  - `GenerationService` class for coordinating fragment generation
  - `parseAndSeparateSchema()` method for core/extension separation
  - `validateCoreSchema()` method for core-only validation
  - `extractCoreContentForGeneration()` method for structured data extraction
  - `generateCompleteYamlFromStub()` method for stub processing
  - `getGenerationDataFromCompleteYaml()` method for fragment extraction

- **Enhanced Validation System**
  - Strict core schema validation with detailed error reporting
  - Field type validation with support for custom types
  - Relationship validation with proper model checking
  - Extension data validation support

- **Stub System**
  - Schema stubs for base templates (basic, blog, user, etc.)
  - Generator stubs for fragment templates
  - Dynamic replacement system for stub processing

- **Comprehensive Documentation**
  - Complete README rewrite with current architecture
  - Architecture guide (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)
  - Migration guide (`docs/MIGRATION.md`)
  - Fragment documentation (`examples/FRAGMENTS.md`)
  - Integration examples (`examples/IntegrationExample.php`)
  - API examples (`examples/SchemaServiceApiExample.php`)
  - Extension API examples (`examples/ApiExtensions.php`)

- **Test Suite Expansion**
  - 151 tests with 743 assertions
  - Complete API coverage for all public methods
  - Integration tests simulating parent application usage
  - Performance and edge case testing

### Changed
- **Breaking**: YAML structure now requires `core:` section for core schema data
- **Breaking**: API completely redesigned around fragment generation
- **Breaking**: Namespace changed from `Grazulex\ModelSchema` to `Grazulex\LaravelModelschema`
- **Breaking**: Removed direct PHP file generation in favor of fragment approach
- **Breaking**: Replaced PHP YAML extension with Symfony YAML component

### Removed
- **Breaking**: Direct file generation methods (`generateModel()`, `generateMigration()`, etc.)
- **Breaking**: Legacy `ModelSchema` class and flat YAML structure
- **Breaking**: PHP YAML extension dependency

### Dependencies
- **Added**: `symfony/yaml: ^7.3` for reliable YAML processing
- **Removed**: PHP YAML extension requirement
- **Updated**: Laravel 12.x compatibility, PHP 8.3+ requirement

### Migration
- See `docs/MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration instructions
- Automatic core wrapping for backward compatibility during transition
- Examples provided for all common migration scenarios

## [1.x.x] - Legacy Versions (Deprecated)

Previous versions are now deprecated. Please migrate to v2.0.0 for continued support.

### Legacy Features
- Flat YAML structure without core/extension separation
- Direct PHP file generation
- `ModelSchema::fromYamlFile()` usage pattern
- PHP YAML extension dependency
